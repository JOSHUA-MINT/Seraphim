# Seraphim — Product Requirements Document & Technical Report

> **Version:** 1.0 · **Date:** May 4, 2026 · **Author:** Joshua · **Status:** Active Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Seraphim** is a zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging platform built entirely in the browser. It uses **OpenPGP.js v5** with **Curve25519 ECC** cryptography to provide users with military-grade encryption for messages, real-time chat, and key management — all without ever exposing plaintext to the server.

The platform operates as a **static web client** + **Node.js relay server**. The server is a dumb pipe — it relays PGP ciphertext between clients and never stores or decrypts any messages.

---

## 2. Product Vision & Goals

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Mission** | Make end-to-end encrypted communication accessible to anyone with a browser |
| **Target Users** | Privacy-conscious individuals, journalists, activists, security researchers |
| **Core Value Prop** | Zero-knowledge architecture — the server cannot read your messages, ever |
| **Differentiator** | Browser-native PGP with no installs, no accounts, no tracking |

# PART 2: Google Stitch Prompts — Per Layout

Below are specific prompts to use in **Google Stitch** for generating layout designs for each page of Seraphim.

---

## Layout 1: Landing Page (`index.html`)

**Description:** A dark, centered hero page. Contains a logo/title at the top, a hero tagline, and a 2×2 grid of feature cards (Encrypt, Decrypt, Key Manager, Secure Chat). Each card has an icon, title, and short description. Footer shows tech stack info.

**Google Stitch Prompt:**

> Design a dark-themed landing page for an encrypted messaging app called "Seraphim". Background is near-black (#07070d) with subtle purple and cyan radial gradient glows. At the top is a logo with a lock emoji and gradient text "Seraphim" (purple to cyan). Below it, a hero section with the heading "End-to-End Encrypted Messaging" in gradient text and a tagline: "Zero-knowledge encryption powered by OpenPGP. Your messages. Your keys. No middleman." Below that, a 2x2 grid of glassmorphism cards with dark semi-transparent backgrounds, subtle borders, and hover glow effects. Each card has a gradient icon box (lock, unlock, key, chat bubble), a bold title, and a short description in muted text. Cards: "Encrypt", "Decrypt", "Key Manager", "Secure Chat". Footer text: "Powered by OpenPGP.js v5 · Curve25519 ECC · Zero-knowledge relay". Typography uses Inter font. Overall aesthetic is cyberpunk, premium, dark, with purple/cyan neon accents.

---

## Layout 2: Encrypt Page (`encrypt.html`)

**Description:** A tool page with a navigation bar, a title section, and a main card containing a message textarea, a public key textarea, a contact loader button, and an encrypt button. Below it, a conditionally-visible output card shows the PGP ciphertext with copy and download buttons.

**Google Stitch Prompt:**

> Design a dark-themed encryption tool page for "Seraphim". Top has a header with logo (left) and a pill-shaped navigation bar (right) with tabs: Encrypt (active/highlighted with purple-cyan gradient), Decrypt, Keys, Chat. Below is a centered heading "🔒 Encrypt Message" in gradient text with subtitle. Main content is a glassmorphism card with: a "Message" textarea (tall, dark input background), a "Recipient's Public Key" textarea with a ghost button "📇 Load from contacts", and a large gradient "🔒 Encrypt Message" button with purple glow shadow. Below that card, an output card labeled "Encrypted Output" shows PGP ciphertext in cyan monospace text on a dark background, with "📋 Copy to Clipboard" and "💾 Download .pgp" buttons. Background is near-black with subtle purple/cyan ambient glows. All inputs have focus states with purple border glow.

---

## Layout 3: Decrypt Page (`decrypt.html`)

**Description:** Similar to encrypt but with fields for: encrypted message textarea, private key textarea (with a "load saved key" button), passphrase input, and a decrypt button. Output card shows decrypted plaintext in green.

**Google Stitch Prompt:**

## Layout 4: Key Manager (`keys.html`)

**Description:** A multi-section page with: (1) Generate Keypair card with name/email/passphrase fields, (2) Generated output card showing public and private keys with copy/save buttons, (3) Saved Keys list card showing key cards with fingerprints and export/delete actions, (4) Contacts card with a list and "Add Contact" button that opens a modal overlay.

**Google Stitch Prompt:**

> Design a dark-themed PGP key management page for "Seraphim". Header with logo + nav bar (Keys tab active). Heading: "🔑 Key Manager" in gradient text. Page has 4 stacked glassmorphism cards: (1) "Generate New Keypair" card — subtitle "ECC Curve25519", two-column row for Name and Email inputs, a Passphrase input below, and a gradient "⚡ Generate Keys" button. (2) "Generated Keypair" output card — shows public key in cyan monospace and private key in pink monospace within dark boxes, with copy buttons and a "💾 Save to Browser" button. (3) "My Saved Keys" card — shows a vertical list of key items with name, email, fingerprint (cyan monospace), and action buttons (export public, export private, delete). (4) "Contacts" card — a list of saved contacts with name and action buttons, plus an "➕ Add Contact" button. All on near-black background with glassmorphism, purple/cyan glow accents, and smooth hover states.

---

## Layout 5: Secure Chat (`chat.html`)

**Description:** Two-panel layout. First panel (join): a centered card with display name, keypair selector, passphrase, and room code fields with a join button. Second panel (chat room): a top bar showing room code + kill switch + leave buttons, a main area with a messages column (left) and users sidebar (right), and a message input bar at the bottom.

**Google Stitch Prompt:**

> Design a dark-themed encrypted chat room for "Seraphim". Two states: (1) JOIN STATE — centered card with heading "💬 Secure Chat", subtitle about E2EE. Card has fields: Display Name input, Keypair dropdown selector, Passphrase input, Room Code input with a "🎲 New" button beside it, and a large gradient "🚀 Join Room" button. (2) CHAT STATE — full-width layout with a top bar showing room code in cyan monospace + "Copy" button + "☠️ Kill Switch" red button + "🚪 Leave" ghost button. Below is a two-column layout: left (75%) has a messages area with sent messages (right-aligned, purple/cyan gradient background) and received messages (left-aligned, dark background) plus system messages (centered, cyan tint), a typing indicator line, and a message input bar with text input + "Send" gradient button. Right sidebar (25%) shows "Online Users" with green pulse dots next to names. Near-black background, glassmorphism, cyberpunk aesthetic.

---

## Layout 6: Test Suite (`test.html`)

**Description:** Minimal developer page with a heading, a "Run All Tests" button, and a terminal-style output box showing test results with colored pass/fail indicators.

**Google Stitch Prompt:**

> Design a minimal dark developer test page. Background is very dark (#0a0a0f). Title "🔐 Seraphim Crypto Test Suite" in purple. A gradient purple-to-cyan button labeled "Run All Tests". Below, a terminal-style output box with dark background (#111118), thin border, monospace font showing test output lines. Pass results in green (#22c55e), fail in red (#ef4444), info lines in blue (#38bdf8), dim/meta text in gray (#555). Output shows numbered tests: Key Generation, Encryption, Decryption, Signing, Verification, Wrong Passphrase rejection, Room Code Generation — each with timing and status indicators. Clean, developer-focused, no glassmorphism.
